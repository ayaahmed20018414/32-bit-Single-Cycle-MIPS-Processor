# 32-bit-Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor
In this project, I implement a 32-bit single-cycle microarchitecture MIPS processor based on Harvard Architect.  In other words instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back, and program counter update occurs within a single clock cycle. I write the RTL Verilog files for all sub-modules of the MIPS processor (e.g. Register File, Instruction Memory, etc.). Then, implementing the top module of the MIPS processor. The single-cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle.
